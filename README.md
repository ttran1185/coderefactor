The first thing I looked at in the html was the locations in the <li> tag and moved the social media and the search engine to match the placement of the two in the body of the site.  In the div for the search engine I added the id allow it to link with the <a href> at the top of the site.  In the benefits class I added <div id> to the 3 options as lead, brand, and cost.  In the css code I took the header div ul and header div ul li and combined them both together.  I had also combined the benefit code for benefit lead, brand and cost for the margin and also h3.  Lastly,  I took the class search online and social and combined them together with the img and h2.
